# Animation_Nav

builiding is quite easy,
 

we just want a click event and toggle property.

So simple when we click on the menu it active the class and when we click again it remove 
the class, so this functionality was done by toggle property 
adding the class or removing a class. 
underneath the hood it have a state it countinously changes when we click on the element.

Hope this explanation help, Simple and Easy.
